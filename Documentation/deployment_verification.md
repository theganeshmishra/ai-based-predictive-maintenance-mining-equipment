# Integrated notebook deployment verification

Verified locally on November 5, 2026. PASS means the route loaded its saved model and returned the equipment mapping, fault class, model confidence, and model name. Image samples include event-camera frames, infrared frames, and synthetic CAD renders.

The Pump and Haul Truck CSVs preserve the samples and channels of their source MAT recordings. Their reported predictions matched the MAT routes. The four CORA mappings required explicit source confirmation. Exact local image fingerprints also resolved the Pump and Haul Truck event-camera exports and Drill Rig CAD renders. Filenames or a confirmed mapping describe a laboratory data source.

The notebook ran in a Jupyter kernel and exercised the upload widget callbacks with real CSV excerpts and image bytes. Checks covered unknown formats, invalid images, short recordings, incompatible mappings, shared CORA formats, and missing sensor and image checkpoints. The optional photo mode separately detected a Wheel Loader, Excavator and Dump Truck and returned ambiguity on a mixed scene. It returns visible equipment identity only.

The Haul Truck CNN predicted outer-race fault for one ball-fault frame. The Drill Rig CNN predicted healthy for one wear render and one pitting render. The deployment checks included training samples. Confidence is a model output. For generalization, use the existing fair tests, which hold out recordings, speeds, bearings or designs. The existing time-split scores use later segments from recordings seen during training. CORA unseen-speed performance is weak in the saved results even when time-split scores are high.

Motor Grader image fault inference remains unavailable. The [JUST slewing-bearing dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hwg8v5j8t6/1) supplies sensor signals. The separate [gear-tooth image dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/vjs-jek7v/gearbox_adddingimg) labels a different component and task. All component routes classify current condition using laboratory analogues. Future failure and remaining useful life are outside the demonstrated scope.

Local test outputs are stored in `Processed_Data/final_deployment_verification.json` and `Processed_Data/whole_machine_verification.json`. Keep the trusted checkpoints and indexed image exports locally when running the demo.


## Grader image data and equipment photo follow-up

| Public source | What it supports | Deployment decision |
|---|---|---|
| [JUST slewing-bearing recordings](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hwg8v5j8t6/1) | Vibration and acoustic signals for healthy, inner ring, outer ring and rolling element conditions | Keep the existing sensor route. |
| [GearBox_adddingImg](https://universe.roboflow.com/vjs-jek7v/gearbox_adddingimg) | Visible gear-tooth damage | Keep the existing separate research result. These labels describe teeth, while the sensor target describes bearing parts. |
| [Bearing-ring surface inspection research](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/21/6504) | Manufacturing surface defects on bearing rings | Useful background for inspection. Its manufacturing defect labels differ from the Grader slewing-bearing fault targets. |
| [ACID](https://www.acidb.net/dataset) and [AIDCON](https://www.ai2lab.org/aidcon/) | Equipment identity annotations, including Grader and Dozer. The full datasets require access requests. | Use the available ACID examples as a smoke test. A fair model comparison would require an independent annotated split. |

No reviewed image source established the Grader fault classes on independent bearing units. A fair Grader image benchmark would require images of the relevant component, verified labels, and multiple units per class. Hold out complete bearing units or machines so repeated views cannot cross the split. Compare a simple baseline with a transfer-learning classifier on identical held-out units using macro F1 and per-class recall.

The existing BuildVision photo detector was checked on four labeled ACID publisher examples. It proposed Excavator at 85.9% and Wheel Loader at 85.2% on their respective examples, returned Unknown Equipment on the Dozer, and incorrectly proposed Wheel Loader at 86.4% on the Grader. It also reported ambiguity on a mixed Excavator and Dump Truck scene from its publisher. These examples verify behavior and expose one failure. Dataset independence and generalization were not established. The notebook marks single photo detections as provisional, includes a pixel box for visual confirmation, and keeps fault inference separate. The local record is `Processed_Data/photo_source_recheck.json`.
